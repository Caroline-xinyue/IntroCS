# IntroCS
Computational Arts created for Introduction to Computing using Java-based Processing language

These are some selected projects programmed for Intro to Computing at Bryn Mawr college during my freshman year. 
They are written in Processing, a Java-based programming language designed mainly for graphical visualization.
I was introduced to Java and the Object Oriented Programming design, and learnt to apply computer science to creative visual arts, 
statistics and other fields.
